# Oil_Environment_R

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to investigate whether there is a relationship between the value of oil companies and the level of public concern regarding environmental issues. Oil company value is measured by the closing price of the company shares on the London Stock Exchange. Google trends data is used as a measure of public concern about environmental issues.

Oil company stock values are also compared to FTSE 100 closing values and petrol prices.

## Conclusion
Using Google search hits as a proxy for public concern we found no evidence of a linear relationship between the value of oil companies and the level of public concern regarding environmental issues. The one instance of a possible linear relationship discovered was between RDSA.L and "climate change" hits but the associated linear model p-value was 0.379 indicating there was no evidence that "climate change" hits explained RDSA.L values.

An unexpected discovery was the changing relationship between FTSE values, petrol prices and RDSA.L values. We saw that, as expected, there was a linear relationship between them but that relationship seems to have been broken around March 2020.

In a follow-up project I will investigate some aspects of the Google search data further; the 'climate change' and 'global warming' values appeared to have a seasonal pattern, would combining the 'climate change' and 'global warming' data be helpful, the possible curvi-linear relationship between the search data and BP.l and RDSA.L values.
