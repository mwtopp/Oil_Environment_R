# Oil_Environment_R

The purpose of this project is to investigate whether there is a relationship between the value of oil companies and the level of public concern regarding environmental issues. Oil company value is measured by the closing price of the company shares on the London Stock Exchange. Google trends data is used as a measure of public concern about environmental issues.

Oil company stock values are also compared to FTSE 100 closing values and petrol prices.
